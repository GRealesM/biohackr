Title: A life hack for getting multiple species sequences from Ensembl.
Version: 0.1.2
Author: Guillermo Reales
Maintainer: Guillermo Reales <grealesm@gmail.com>
Description: Ensembl makes data freely accessible through biomaRt, however datasets are organized 
    by species, and therefore it is not straightforward to extract information and sequences across 
    different species in just one call. Biohackr intends to simplify things by providing a simple
    hack for retrieving homolog IDs and sequences from many different species at once.
